# Terminal

    - command prompt
    - terminal

# Node

## How do we change node versions? How can we check our node version

We use NVM -> Node Version Manager
Whenever we change node version, we want to make sure we also set it to default

# add a new version
nvm install 16

# switch between versions
nvm use 16

# set a default version
nvm alias default 16

# What is (npm v8.19.4)?

NPM -> node package manager
Please refrain from upgrading your npm version

If your terminal is telling you to run a command in order to fix something, ask us first or learn what the command does first before running

# Something broke OMG WHAT NOW?

Don't panic, breaking things happen at least 99.9% of the time in web development.
